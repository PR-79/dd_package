LOG DEBUGGING ShorTest

Remark. There are 17 qubits in the circuit, but the 18th qubit is addressed by gate #22.
If I correctly notify the circuit that 18 qubits exist in the circuit, then the test passes.
What is the effect of telling the circuit this, exactly?

All Shor benchmarks pass.

+ collect all failing benchmarks from Stefan's spreadsheet.
  + The 325 benchmarks exit in the following ways:
    * 6/325: TooManyQubits
    * 5/325: std::bitset out of range
    * 10/325: various std::runtime_error:
      * 3/10: canonical labels may only be created for vectors; not for matrices
      * 6/10: Numerical instability occurred during measurement
      * 1/10: LimTable: RefCount of entry
    * 17/325: timeout (>900 seconds)

+ run those failing benchmarks in the terminal
+ keep track of results, in a spreadsheet of my own
  Some categories:
  - passes on my end; fails on theirs. Should pass this on; very strange
  - numerical error; don't see anything I can do about it
  - canonical label stuff; I think we already fixed that earlier??
  - too many qubits; todo see if we can fix that
  - bitset error; todo this I can do
    - steaneQ7_cBigEnt_n02.qasm is the only one that fails on my end. I've heard about that one before. I think it passes with debug flags?
    + todo turn on debug flags
      + in the terminal it fails
      + run with gdb
        it fails with the following backtrack:

       So, the thing that's passed contains an identity column. But all identity columns are supposed to have be removed before the get to recoverPhase...
       In fact, the only arguments to recoverPhase are the stabilizer groups of various nodes, but these are supposed to be pruned before they are put in the cache...
    - put a sanity check in the code that initializes a node's stabilizer group (in makeDDNode): no identity LIMs
    - put a sanity check in the code getcosetintersectionelementpauli
    I think I fixed a bug: when constructStabilizerGeneratorSet calls toColumnEchelonForm, it only deleted identities; but it should have also deleted identities modulo phase.
      I repaired this: now also identities modulo phase are deleted.
    Now it fails differently depending on how it is called:
     * in the terminal,   what():  bitset::set: __position (which is 18446744073709551614) >= _Nb (which is 254)
     * in gdb: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
                 what():  [normalizeLIMDD] ERROR in step 4: old node is not isomorphic to canonical node.
    this is very confusing.
    I fixed another bug, I think. In getIsomorphism, in the case if (uLow.p == vHigh.p && uHigh.p == vLow.p && uLow.p != uHigh.p), there was a check if (!foundIsomorphism), which I changed to if (foundIsomorphism).
    but even after this bugfix, I still get an error in the terminal:
      what():  [normalizeLIMDD] ERROR in step 4: old node is not isomorphic to canonical node.
    What is the cause of this non-canonical error? Is the node actually not canonical; did something go wrong?
    Or is it an error finding the right isomorphism?
    I ran it again, and now it gives a different error:
      what():  Numerical instability occurred during measurement: |alpha|^2 + |beta|^2 = 0.986328 + 0.000000 = 0.986328, but should be 1!
    It's good that I don't get the other error anymore... But why do I get this now? Did I solve the other bug?
    I solved all the bugs that were tractable:
     * bitset: 4/5 I cannot reproduce, the remaining 1/5 I solved
     * refcount: cannot reproduce
     * canonical labels: error is thrown because some functionality is not supported.
     * numerical instability: no idea where to begin; maybe is not important?
     * too many qubits: I can solve
     todo try again with debug mode and {terminal, gdb}
     - compile in debug mode
     + run in terminal; the error message is:
       what():  [getIsomorphism] no isomorphism, case 5
       This is strange; it's a different error message than with Release mode!!

     - run in gdb; what is the error message?

LOG OF SOLVING TOO MANY QUBITS ERROR
I change the number of qubits from 126 to 250.
This seems to be very difficult and causes lots of compilation errors.





-- coding, functionality

in makeDDNode, delete the old low and high LIMs of the edge

- Optimize `GramSchmidt()` from $O(n^3)$ to O(n^2)$ by assuming that the group `G` is in column echelon form
- (low priority) in `getIsomorphismPauli()` in Case 3.1, can we simply set 'X' in the isomorphism, instead of multiplying by an isomorphism?
- (low priority) in `intersectGroupsPauli()`, prevent the use of `vector oppositePhaseGenerators` by writing more space-efficient code:
   add the LimEntry objects immediately, instead of storing them for later use.

-- TESTS

Write many tests for
    GaussianElimination,
        when -I is generated
    getVector
write test for recoverPhase(G, a)
write test for recoverElement

-- REFACTORING (low priority)

refactor LimEntry<>::setOperator so that one function is called,
    instead of two different setOperators
    note that pauli_op is already defined in terms of 'I' and 'X' and so on, so it should already translate correctly

Refactor 'limVector' into 'StabilizerGroup'

    Use a cached weight in getHighLabelPauli
    in normalizeLIMDDPauli, allocate a cached weight, weightInv that highLabel can use,

in normalizeLIMDD, in the high knife case, do we remove the high label, if it is present?
    it seemes counterintuitive to do, but we should set the label to I

all tests pass under Pauli group

add <Z>-LIMDD functionality to

refactor getIsomorphismPauli so that it returns a LIM with a weight

refactor highLabelPauli so that it returns a LimWeight object, with the new weight and new LIM
    (maybe not, since the returnToCache() obligations on normalizeLIMDD() would be more complicated

Is the 's' and 'x' parameters useful?
    write this algorithm on paper, or find it in notebook
    If the 's' or 'x' is not used, then remove it from the highlabel parameters

make very detailed writeup of getIsomorphismPauli in pdf, explaining all the reasoning.
    This is also important for other people, and myself, to understand the algorithms.

implement 'follow' and 'unfollow' for the Pauli group
    amounts to implementing X and Y

in normalizeLIMDDPauli, in the knife cases, make sure the two edges point to the same node.

Take steps to fix the segmentation faults, invalid free errors
    make a vNode destructor, which does nothing.
    repair memory leaks in all the methods that need it, in PauliAlgebra.hpp
    (Sebastiaan fixed these)
    
The following tests fail:
[  FAILED  ] LimTest.simpleCliffordCircuit
    Because simulation is not yet supported; only representation is supported
[  FAILED  ] DDPackageTest.VectorSerializationTest
    Because serialize() and deserialize() do not support LIMDDs yet
[  FAILED  ] DDPackageTest.BasicNumericStabilityTest
    Because it stores the state |-> = |0> - |1>.
    It assumes the high edge weight will be -sqrt 2.
    However, with the new LIMDD functionality, this is stored as Z|+>  =  Z(|0> + |1>),
    so the weight is +sqrt 2 instead of -sqrt 2.

Add a parameter to the dd stating the group, 'Z', 'Pauli', 'QMDD' / 'trivial'
    refactor the group to enum LIMDD_group type



Ask Linz to help design the division and multiplications that are needed

GramSchmidt is used here:
    getCosetIntersectionElementPauli uses GramSchmidt(Group, LimBitset*)
        result is used as a local variable
        SOLVED has no memory leaks
    getCosetIntersectionElementPauli uses GramSchmidt(Group, LimEntry*, bitset)

PauliAlgebra.hpp: implement several algorithms without a memory leak:
	- GramSchmidt
		Can be implemented with almost no reallocation of memory
		e.g., the 'y' object can be a local variable, instead of a pointer
	- GaussianElimination(LimEntry)
	   the following line may introduce a memory leak, by allocating a new LimEntry without deallocating the previous content of G[reduceColId]
        G[reduceColId] = LimEntry<NUM_QUBITS>::multiply(G[reduceColId], G[reducingColId]);
	- GaussianEliminationModuloPhase
